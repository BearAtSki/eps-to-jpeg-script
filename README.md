# eps-to-jpeg-script

A simple Photoshop script that opens every single eps file in a specified folder and makes a series of actions:

* changes the default height/width values
* changes the color mode to RGB,
* changes the DPI,
* resizes the image if needed,
* saves the JPEG file to the source folder,
* closes the document.

..and a .vbs script that changes the path of the source folder in the .jsx file without the need to open it.
